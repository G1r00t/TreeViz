# TreeViz â€“ Python AST Explorer

**TreeViz** is a web application that allows users to upload Python files and view the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) structure generated using [Tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/), a fast and efficient parsing system.

## How it Works

This project uses **Tree-sitter** to parse Python source code and generate its Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). Here's how it's set up:

### 1. **Tree-sitter Integration**

- The `tree_sitter` Python bindings are used to load the Tree-sitter grammar for Python.
- A `Parser` object is initialized using this language grammar.
- When a file is uploaded, the source code is parsed into a `tree` object.
- The root node of the tree is recursively traversed to extract:
  - Function definitions
  - Class definitions
  - Import statements
- Each node in the AST includes:
  - Type of construct (e.g., `function_definition`, `import_statement`, `class_definition`)
  - Byte offsets and character positions
  - Structural relationships among nodes

Example of setting up the parser:

```python
from tree_sitter import Language, Parser
import tree_sitter_python as ts_python

PY_LANGUAGE = Language(ts_python.language())
parser = Parser()
parser.set_language(PY_LANGUAGE)
```
### 2. AST Traversal and Node Extraction

The parser output is walked recursively to gather semantic information such as:

- **functions**: names of all functions defined  
- **classes**: names of all class definitions  
- **imports**: all import statements  

The system filters and processes nodes based on types and context to keep the output relevant and clean.

## Try It Live

You can use the live version of the app here:

**[https://treeviz.up.railway.app/](https://treeviz.up.railway.app/)**

### What You Can Do:

- Upload a `.py` file directly through the interface.
- View the extracted AST structure (currently limited to Python).
- Internally, your uploaded code is parsed and analyzed using Tree-sitter.
